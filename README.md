# NHS Scotland A&E Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyses weekly Accident & Emergency (A&E) activity and waiting times across Scotland using open data published by NHS Scotland.

The analysis focuses on understanding emergency care demand, system performance, and regional disparities across Health Boards before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Objectives
- Analyse trends in A&E attendance volumes over time  
- Evaluate performance against key waiting time targets (4h, 8h, 12h)  
- Identify post-pandemic changes in system efficiency  
- Explore regional differences in emergency care performance across Health Boards  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Findings
- Overall A&E attendance volumes remained relatively stable over time.
- Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of patients seen within 4 hours has declined.
- Delays exceeding 8 and 12 hours increased post-pandemic, indicating growing system strain.
- Significant regional disparities exist across Health Boards, suggesting structural and capacity-related challenges.
